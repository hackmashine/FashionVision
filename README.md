# fashion FashionVision: Clothing classification using CNN (PyTorch)

This project is a neural network for spreading ideas from year to year. **The fashion designer**.  
The network learns to distinguish between **10 classes**:
- T-shirt/Top  
- Trousers  
- A pullover  
- Dress  
- Coat  
- Sandals  
- Shirt  
- Running shoes  
- The bag  
- Ankle boots  

## üìä Description
- Use **accurate information (CNN)** on PyTorch.  
- The training is conducted in the language of "Modeler".  
- Added **graph classification** (loss of accuracy).  
- A **confusion matrix** has been built to eliminate model errors.  
- There is an opportunity to find out **your public photos** (jpg/png).  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology stack
- Python 3  
- PyTorch  
- Torchvision  
- Matplotlib + Seaborn  
- scikit-learn
